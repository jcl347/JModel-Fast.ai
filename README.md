# FastAI Part 1 - Deep Learning Course

## Overview
This repository captures my learning journey through **Part 1 of the FastAI Deep Learning course** ([course.fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/)) and the accompanying **FastAI book** ([Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/Resources/book.html)). The course and book are designed to make deep learning accessible by using a top-down approach, allowing students to build practical AI applications quickly before diving into theoretical concepts.

## Course Structure
Part 1 covers:
- Introduction to deep learning and the FastAI library
- Training state-of-the-art models with transfer learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Transformers
- Tabular and structured data modeling
- Collaborative filtering for recommendation systems
- Model interpretation, debugging, and deployment

The course focuses on hands-on learning with Jupyter notebooks, real-world datasets, and FastAI's high-level abstractions that simplify deep learning implementations.

## FastAI Book Notebooks
In addition to the course notebooks, this repository includes Jupyter notebooks based on **Deep Learning for Coders with FastAI & PyTorch** ([book link](https://course.fast.ai/Resources/book.html)). These notebooks provide additional insights and practical exercises to deepen understanding. Topics covered in the book include:
- Practical deep learning workflows
- Advanced computer vision techniques
- Time series forecasting
- Ethical considerations in AI
- Scaling and deploying deep learning models

The book's official Jupyter notebooks can be accessed at the FastAI GitHub repository: [https://github.com/fastai/fastbook](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook)
