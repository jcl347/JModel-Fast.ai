# FastAI Part 1 - Deep Learning Course

## Overview
This repository captures my learning journey through **Part 1 of the FastAI Deep Learning course** ([course.fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/)). The course is designed to make deep learning accessible by using a top-down approach, allowing students to build practical AI applications quickly before diving into theoretical concepts.

## Course Structure
Part 1 covers:
- Introduction to deep learning and the FastAI library
- Training state-of-the-art models with transfer learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Transformers
- Tabular and structured data modeling
- Collaborative filtering for recommendation systems
- Model interpretation, debugging, and deployment

The course focuses on hands-on learning with Jupyter notebooks, real-world datasets, and FastAI's high-level abstractions that simplify deep learning implementations.

## Credits
- Course by **Jeremy Howard** and the **FastAI team**
- Based on the **FastAI library** and **PyTorch**
- Official course link: [https://course.fast.ai/](https://course.fast.ai/)

## Future Work
- Expanding projects based on course learnings
- Experimenting with custom datasets
- Contributing to the FastAI community
